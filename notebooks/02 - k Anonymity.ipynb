    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "k-anonymity protects the privacy of individual persons by pooling their attributes into groups of at least $k$ people. The method is based on the assumption that we have a dataset that contains $N$ entries. Each entry consists of a list of $D$ attributes $X_i$ ($i \\in [0,D]$) that contain (non-sensitive) information about a person, such as age, gender, zip code of residence, etc. These attributes are called \"quasi-identifiers\", as combining several of them into a \"super-identifier\" can often uniquely identify a person even in large datasets (e.g. the combination of gender, age and zip code might be so specific that only a single person in a dataset has a given combination). In addition, the model assumes that the dataset contains a single sensitive attribute that contains e.g. information about a person's income and that we want to protect. The method can also be generalized to datasets with more than one sensitive attribute or datasets where there's no clear distinction between quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. For this case study we will look at the simple case though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, k-anonymity demands that we group individual rows/persons of our dataset into group of at least $k$ rows/persons and replace the quasi-identifier attributes of these rows with aggregate quantities, such that it is no longer possible to read the individual values. This protects people by ensuring that an adversary who knows all values of a person's quasi-identifier attributes can only find out which group a person might belong to but not know if the person is really in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large problem of this approach is that it might happen that all people in a k-anonymous group possess the same value of the sensitive attribute. An adversary who knows that a person is in that k-anonymous group can then still learn the value of the sensitive attribute of that person with absolute certainty. This problem can be fixed by using an extension of k-anonymity called \"l-diversity\": l-diversity ensures that each k-anonymous group contains at least l different values of the sensitive attribute. Therefore, evne if an adversary can identify the group of a person he/she still would not be able to find out the value of that person's sensitive attribute with certainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, even when using l-diversity an adversary could still learn some information about a person's sensitive attribute using probabilistic reasoning: If, for example, 4 out of 5 people in a 5-anonymous group possess a given value of the sensitive attribute, an attacker can reason that a given person who he/she knows is part of the group will -with high probability- possess that value. Again, this problem can be fixed by extending k-anonymity using a so-called \"t-closeness\" criterion: t-closeness demands that the statistical distribution of the sensitive attribute values in each k-anonymous group is \"close\" to the overall distribution of that attribute in the entire dataset. Typically, the closeness can be measured using e.g. the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. An adversary could then only learn a limited amount of information from comparing the distribution of the values in the group to the distribution in the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness all limit the amount of information that a legitimate user can learn from the data as well, so typically we need to balance the degree of privacy against the utility of the resulting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing k-anonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning a dataset into a k-anonymous (and possibly l-diverse or t-close) dataset is a complex problem, and finding the optimal partition into k-anonymous groups is an NP-hard problem. Fortunately, several practical algorithms exists that often produce \"good enough\" results by employing greedy search techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will explore the so-called \"Mondrian\" algorithm (see link above), which uses a greedy search algorithm to parition the original data into smaller and smaller groups (if we plot the resulting partition boundaries in 2D they resemble the pictures by Piet Mondrian, hence the name).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm assumes that we have converted all attributes into numerical or categorical values and that we're able to measure the \"span\" of a given data attribute $X_i$ (we'll explain that in more detail later).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds then as follows to partition the data into k-anonymous gorups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the finished set of partitions to an empty set $P_{finished} = \\{\\}$.\n",
    "2. Initialize the working set of paritions to a set containing a partition with the entire dataset $P_{working} = \\{\\{1, 2,\\dots ,N\\}\\}$.\n",
    "4. While there are partitions in the working set, pop one partition from it and\n",
    "  * Calculate the relative spans of all columns in the partition.\n",
    "  * Sort the resulting columns by their span (in descending order) and iterate over them. For each column,\n",
    "      * Try to split the partition along that column using the median of the column values as the split point.\n",
    "      * Check if the resulting partitions are valid according to our k-anonymity (and possibly additional) criteria.\n",
    "      * If yes, add the two new partitions to the working set and break out of the loop.\n",
    "  * If no column produced a valid split, add the original partition to the set of finished partitions.\n",
    "5. Return the finished set of partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the partitions we still need to aggregate the values of the quasi identifiers and the sensitive attributes in each k-anonymous group. For this, we can e.g. replace numerical attributes with their range (e.g. \"age: 24-28\") and categorical attributes with their union (e.g. \"employment-group: [self-employed, employee, worker]\"), though other aggregations are possible. Methods like [Anatomy](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.156.9150&rep=rep1&type=pdf) even preserve the micro-data in each group, which increases re-identification risk though.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Usage of the Anonymized Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the anonymized data for privacy-preserving machine learning, e.g. using scikit-learn. We'll see an example of that at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with the anonymization!"
